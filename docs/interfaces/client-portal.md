# Client Portal Interface

**Purpose** of this interface is to share it with your client by giving them **read only** access to this specific interface.

In the client portal interface the client will be able to **access their own data** as long as you invite them via an email address that matches with the one in the Clients table.

They can:

- Review upstanding billable hours and billable projects
- Current and past invoices
- Know ahead of time what they'll be invoiced next time
